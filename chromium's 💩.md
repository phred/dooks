# Sometimes ğŸ’© just doesn't work.

Chromium has paddled down a river of ğŸ’© to get ğŸ’© looking pretty on OS X.

â€¦

Well, as pretty as ğŸ’© can look.

Summary:
- ğŸ’©' s broke.
- People would like more ğŸ’© in their Chromium.
- There's some weird ğŸ’© going on down in the text rendering engine.
- Lots of ğŸ’© discussion, but ğŸ’©'s still broke.
